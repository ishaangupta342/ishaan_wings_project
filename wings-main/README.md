In order to run the following project, follow the steps below-

1.First, go into the Proj-CS207/ and import the databases Flightsdata.sql , bookings.sql & signup.sql into your localhost.

2. Copy the Proj-CS207 into your htdocs folder of your Xampp installation.

3. Open your XAMPP.

4. Open your browser and paste this link â€“ http://localhost/Proj-CS207/Main.php.

5. The email is sent through the smtp protocol. Most likely, the server will try blocking the email being sent. To avoid this, the gmail(or other) security has a protocol in place, which needs to be disabled.

6. The passenger details can be seen on the bookings table, and the flight details (the number of seats left etc can be seen in the flights table of database_1)
